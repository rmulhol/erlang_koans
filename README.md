#Erlang Koans

##Description
These are my solutions to the [Erlang Koans](https://github.com/patrickgombert/erlang-koans).

##How to Run
To complete the unsolved koans, clone the repo from the link above and work your way through.

To run the tests verifying that these solutions are complete, navigate to the erlang-koans directory and run `escript koans`.

##Versions
These koans were completed with Erlang/OTP 17.

##Epilogue
Namaste.
